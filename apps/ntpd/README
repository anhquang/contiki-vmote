TODO:
- define to comment out server-functions (e.g. ntp_server_send @ntpd). Normal
  motes doesn't need to be an NTP server
- make one-source-code-for-many-platforms (with define, of course). Current
  code work with sky only.


BUG:
- seem client print out "current time ..." *a lot*
- too big offset, the adjust-time function could not work (big bug)
